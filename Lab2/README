The first program "treasure" Takes a 'map' that is a file with coordinates.
It follows the coordinates indicated in each step of the map until it finds the one that points to itself.
Then it outputs every step taken until the trasure was found. 
The files were in the form:

01 11 12
00 12 02

Where every coordinate was in written as [next row][next column]. 
In this example the treasure is on 12 because it is pointing to itself

The second program "sort" Takes a list of CPUs with its characteristics and sorts them from the fastest to the slowest.
The characteristics included: Processor speed, cache size, brand, etc..
The user can select which output wants to be seen
