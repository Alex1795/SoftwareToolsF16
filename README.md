# SoftwareToolsF16
Projects for my ECE364 (Software tools) class 

Here I have the laboratories and final project for my Softare tools class that I took on Purdue on Fall 2016.
Most of the code here is written in Python, except for the first 3 that are written on bash.

The final project is an homography app. Where the GUI takes any image and after applying some lienal algebra changes the plane where the image is displayed. This application uses the libraries numpy and scipy and the GUI was made using Qt.
